============ BEGINNGING OF STORY 1 ================
Nick, Connor, Foaad, and Ted, had banded together as what seemed like the last survivors. The zombie apocalypse started 2 months ago, but the survivors knew more humans were still alive.

Zombies broke past their barricades. They all had to move quickly outside and luckily into their black hummer.

The refugees heard a loud growling noise nearby.

Everyone was quiet. The zombies were close but unaware of their presence.

The streets were filled with zombies crawling on top of a black hummer

It starts to rain. The last thing Foaad needs is wet gear and he makes it known. They look inside a nearby run-down hospital.

There was a draft in the building. Really quite irritating.

As our Village People, as they called themselves, turns the corner, several zombies awake and beginning to sense the survivors. No one dares to take a step and set them off.

Through the ceiling, a huge Jockey Zombie fell on top of Ted. He became so enraged that he threw the zombie and a dozen other zombies out a window.

The next hallway was filled with zombies and the survivors are low on ammunition. Foaad starts the action by blasting a Boomer Zombie from across the hall with his rifle.

The gang tries the elevator, but of course the door is pryed open. Inside the elevator shaft, zombies start crawling up the side. A Tank Zombie grabs Nick, in a cunning move, Foaad shoots the elevator cable like he's seen in movies. The elevator comes crashing down and kills the zombies.

Nick shoots a large fixture above a Spitter Zombie. The ceiling detaches and crushes the zombies, unfortunately destorying their path.

A huge Tank Zombie threw Connor to the ground and tore off his head. Blood everywhere.

Foaad plows though a small bunch of zombies, crushing the skull of each one.

The top of the run-down hospital is their goal. Flight after flight they've tried and now at what seems to be the 100th flight stands a Boomer Zombie. Nick uses a rocket launcher to vaporize it.

Foaad kills a Hunter Zombie, but the zombie's guts spoiled the bit of crackers they had left. Hopefully more food could be found in the run-down hospital.

Ted kicks open the door to the roof. Outside there are a couple zombies that Ted tosses off the edge. The helicopter circles around and spots the survivors. They're carried away


=============== END OF STORY 1 ====================
============ BEGINNGING OF STORY 2 ================
In San Francisco, one rough group of odd characters were banded together. The zombie apocalypse started only months ago. There were a group of survivors who had been hiding in Foaad's house for the past three days and needed to venture out for more food and ammunition. Some still thought more people were out there.

The survivors ran outside into their black hummer.

Walking down the street, Foaad stumbled over a trashcan making a loud clamor that echoed into the distance.

Foaad mentioned the gathering of zombies in the distance.

The wind kicked up; Nick shivered. There was a faint howl in the distance.

Foaad reloaded his gun. Danger was near. The last few zombies didn't stand a chance against his shot gun.

The Village People, as they called themselves, was together and out of zombie danger. They barricaded a steel door behind them and took a moment to recuperate.

Ted shot a zombie standing next to an burnt police cruiser. Unluckily the car alarm still worked. Every zombie in the area started rushing towards Ted. A Jockey Zombie took the front of the crowd, crushing several of his zombie allies. Foaad set up a propane tank trap and ran as fast as possible. Impossibly, he shot over his shoulder and set off the bomb just in time. The gang was safe.

There was a loud bang as a Smoker Zombie with a whole horde of zombies crashed threw the wall be Ted and Nick pinning them to the wall. In an amazing show of bravery Nick shot the zombies pinning them to the wall and saved everyone.

In a tight street, Charger Zombie and Smoker Zombie approached the survivors from either side. Ted killed both with amazing marksmanship.

In the window above, a Hunter Zombie spotted them.

Nick knew they needed to cross town. In the daylight, it was essential to move as quickly as possible. The survivors look behind them and see a Spitter Zombie chasing them. Nick lights up a tank of gasoline and forms a wall of fire to seal off the street.

The gang drove down the street toward the grocery store.

With the escape boat in sight, a Hunter Zombie jumps out and surprises Foaad. Foaad quickly cuts the zombie's head off.

Off in the distance, the refugees see a boat tied to the dock. Could the ocean give them refuge?

From the high vantage point, the refugees catch sight of the boat. Plenty of zombies stand between them and potential safety.

Nick blast the last few remaining zombies from the dock attached to the boat. They jump in and untie the boat. The characters feel safe for once as the boat slowly drifts into the ocean.

Eric set up a gasoline filled trap while the others stood back in case the zombies surprised him. Andrew caught the attention of a horde of zombies and led them straight into the trap which turned into an inferno with a quick shot from Mike's gun. The zombies burned slowly; the smell was awful.

A huge Tank Zombie threw Andrew to the ground and tore off his head. Blood everywhere.

The gang was sprinting between shadowed corners. Mike tripped briefly and alerted a nearby Hunter Zombie. Everyone tensed and quickly pulled their comrade up.

Eric fixed up a barricade in an attempt to escape the rushing horde. It wasn't going to hold. There were too many zombies. Foaad set up a distraction. Blasting away all the zombies from a nearby window.

Eric was badly wounded in the arm while killing a Charger Zombie.

Foaad declares they haven't yet found safety. Moving seems like the best option.

In a tight street, Tank Zombie and Boomer Zombie approached the group from either side. Foaad killed both with amazing marksmanship.

It starts to rain. The last thing Foaad needs is wet gear and he makes it known. They look inside a nearby crashed airplane.

The next hallway was filled with zombies and the survivors are low on ammunition. Mike starts the action by blasting a Smoker Zombie from across the hall with his rifle.

Through the ceiling, a huge Smoker Zombie fell on top of Foaad. He became so enraged that he threw the zombie and a dozen other zombies out a window.

The survivors tries the elevator, but of course the door is pryed open. Inside the elevator shaft, zombies start crawling up the side. A Tank Zombie grabs Eric, in a cunning move, Mike shoots the elevator cable like he's seen in movies. The elevator comes crashing down and kills the zombies.

Mike kills a Charger Zombie, but the zombie's guts spoiled the bit of crackers they had left. Hopefully more food could be found in the crashed airplane.

Eric shoots a large fixture above a Hunter Zombie. The ceiling detaches and crushes the zombies, unfortunately destorying their path.

Eric kicks open the door to the roof. Outside there are a couple zombies that Foaad tosses off the edge. The helicopter circles around and spots the survivors. They're carried away

In the small town of Ravenholdt, one rough refugees of odd characters were banded together. The zombie apocalypse started only months ago. There were a group of survivors who had been hiding in Mike's house for the past three days and needed to venture out for more food and ammunition. Some still thought more people were out there.

The Village People, as they called themselves, ran outside into their run-down ambulance.

The streets were filled with zombies crawling on top of a run-down ambulance

Walking down the street, Mike stumbled over a trashcan making a loud clamor that echoed into the distance.

There was a loud bang as a Jockey Zombie with a whole horde of zombies crashed threw the wall be Foaad and Eric pinning them to the wall. In an amazing show of bravery Foaad shot the zombies pinning them to the wall and saved everyone.

Everyone was quiet. The zombies were close but unaware of their presence.

A Spitter Zombie rushes towards the survivors, followed by zombie stragglers. Mike dodges several swipes by another Jockey Zombie, then Foaad shoots both zombie threats.

It takes almost all of the ammunition Eric has loaded, but he finally brings down a Spitter Zombie.

Foaad shot a zombie standing next to an burnt police cruiser. Unluckily the car alarm still worked. Every zombie in the area started rushing towards Eric. A Smoker Zombie took the front of the crowd, crushing several of his zombie allies. Foaad set up a propane tank trap and ran as fast as possible. Impossibly, he shot over his shoulder and set off the bomb just in time. The group was safe.

While they drove across the bridge a large mutant zombie smashed the front of their car, throwing them out.

In a moment of hope, Foaad found a stash of batteries, bottled water, and a broken radio. Maybe fixing the radio could reveal another human Village People, as they called themselves,?

The wind kicked up; Mike shivered. There was a faint howl in the distance.

As the refugees dashed street after stree, Mike shot a Smoker Zombie in the face killing it.

From the high vantage point, the survivors catch sight of the boat. Plenty of zombies stand between them and potential safety.

The Village People, as they called themselves, saw an old barricaded crashed airplane. Obvious signs of human struggle were everywhere.

Off in the distance, the group see a boat tied to the dock. Could the ocean give them refuge?

Eric blast the last few remaining zombies from the dock attached to the boat. They jump in and untie the boat. The characters feel safe for once as the boat slowly drifts into the ocean.

============ BEGINNGING OF STORY 1 ================
Foaad, Eric, Nick, and Ted, had banded together as what seemed like the last survivors. The zombie apocalypse started 2 months ago, but the survivors knew more humans were still alive.

The survivors ran outside into their run-down ambulance.

A cloud moved across the sky, blocking the moon; it got unbearably dark.

Ted wants to find a new hideout before dark, so they quickly move across town in search of shelter.

They where less the 300 yards to the boat that was there safety when a Spitter Zombie jumped them. Foaad shot his crossbow and hit the zombie in the eye.

The survivors drove down the street toward the grocery store.

They all huddled around Foaad to reload.

Ted set up a gasoline filled trap while the others stood back in case the zombies surprised him. Nick caught the attention of a horde of zombies and led them straight into the trap which turned into an inferno with a quick shot from Foaad's gun. The zombies burned slowly; the smell was awful.

While they drove across the bridge a large mutant zombie smashed the front of their car, throwing them out.

A Boomer Zombie rushes towards the survivors, followed by zombie stragglers. Nick dodges several swipes by another Spitter Zombie, then Nick shoots both zombie threats.

Eric is severely wounded by a rampaging zombie. He's hurt but not a zombie.

Eric reloaded his gun. Danger was near. The last few zombies didn't stand a chance against his shot gun.

More guns! Foaad threw down his baseball bat and picked up something with a little more power.

Eric shot a zombie standing next to an burnt police cruiser. Unluckily the car alarm still worked. Every zombie in the area started rushing towards Ted. A Smoker Zombie took the front of the crowd, crushing several of his zombie allies. Eric set up a propane tank trap and ran as fast as possible. Impossibly, he shot over his shoulder and set off the bomb just in time. The group was safe.

Nick shoots a gas tank attached to a car which explodes killing a Smoker Zombie and igniting the combustible zombies nearby.

It takes almost all of the ammunition Foaad has loaded, but he finally brings down a Smoker Zombie.

Nick blast the last few remaining zombies from the dock attached to the boat. They jump in and untie the boat. The characters feel safe for once as the boat slowly drifts into the ocean.

In the small town of Ravenholdt, one rough survivors of odd characters were banded together. The zombie apocalypse started only months ago. There were a group of survivors who had been hiding in Ted's house for the past three days and needed to venture out for more food and ammunition. Some still thought more people were out there.

Zombies broke past their barricades. They all had to move quickly outside and luckily into their run-down ambulance.

The wind kicked up; Ted shivered. There was a faint howl in the distance.

Nick mentioned the gathering of zombies in the distance.

In a tight street, Hunter Zombie and Jockey Zombie approached the group from either side. Foaad killed both with amazing marksmanship.

Boomer Zombie jumped out from a window above Ted, crushing his leg and throwing dust into the air. Eric pushed the zombie off with the but of his gun and delivered a fatal blast.

Eric was badly wounded in the arm while killing a Boomer Zombie.

The group heard a loud growling noise nearby.

Eric fixed up a barricade in an attempt to escape the rushing horde. It wasn't going to hold. There were too many zombies. Eric set up a distraction. Blasting away all the zombies from a nearby window.

There was a loud bang as a Boomer Zombie with a whole horde of zombies crashed threw the wall be Foaad and Foaad pinning them to the wall. In an amazing show of bravery Foaad shot the zombies pinning them to the wall and saved everyone.

With a newly-equipped rifle, Ted blasts a Charger Zombie from the center of it's zombie horde.

Out of nowhere the Village People, as they called themselves, was cornered by a Tank Zombie.

Eric steadies his rifle and shoots a Jockey Zombie cleanly from yards away.

Foaad pushes the remaining survivors out of the car, then drives it head on into a Spitter Zombie and jumps out at the last second. In the dust, Foaad see that the car trick worked perfectly.

Ted is grabbed through a window by a Tank Zombie. Eric attempts to remove it. He can't remove hands at the rate they emerge from the window and eventually their comrade is gone.

Ted drove the car over a Smoker Zombie completely destroying the large zombie, causing structural damage to their car.

Foaad managed to bludgeon a Smoker Zombie to death with his bare hands.

The gang was together and out of zombie danger. They barricaded a steel door behind them and took a moment to recuperate.

A huge Charger Zombie threw Eric to the ground and tore off his head. Blood everywhere.

Foaad destroyed a Smoker Zombie by rolling a refrigerator out of a third-story window with pinpoint accuracy.

From an unnoticed portal, a Smoker Zombie crawls through and bites Nick. Ted blasts the zombie away, but it is too late for his bitten comrade. Foaad watch him slowly turn. The sight is uttery gruesome. Ted puts the thing out of misery as everyone stands in awe.

Off in the distance, the Village People, as they called themselves, see a boat tied to the dock. Could the ocean give them refuge?

Ted declares they haven't yet found safety. Moving seems like the best option.

By complete surprise, Ted found a zombie gathering and remove it with a skillful toss of a grenade.

From the high vantage point, the Village People, as they called themselves, catch sight of the boat. Plenty of zombies stand between them and potential safety.

The survivors turned a corner and found themselves in a staring contest with a Smoker Zombie.

A Boomer Zombie charges at Foaad. Foaad deals a tremendous blow with a bat killing the zombie. And there what much rejoicing.

Suddenly the group is surrounded by the biggest horde of zombies that they have ever seen led by a Smoker Zombie. Each survivor is torn apart brutally and killed.

It starts to rain. The last thing Ted needs is wet gear and he makes it known. They look inside a nearby bombed-out apartment building.

Through the ceiling, a huge Hunter Zombie fell on top of Andrew. He became so enraged that he threw the zombie and a dozen other zombies out a window.

Eric kills a Boomer Zombie, but the zombie's guts spoiled the bit of crackers they had left. Hopefully more food could be found in the bombed-out apartment building.

Mike shoots a large fixture above a Hunter Zombie. The ceiling detaches and crushes the zombies, unfortunately destorying their path.

The survivors tries the elevator, but of course the door is pryed open. Inside the elevator shaft, zombies start crawling up the side. A Jockey Zombie grabs Eric, in a cunning move, Mike shoots the elevator cable like he's seen in movies. The elevator comes crashing down and kills the zombies.

The top of the bombed-out apartment building is their goal. Flight after flight they've tried and now at what seems to be the 100th flight stands a Charger Zombie. Andrew uses a rocket launcher to vaporize it.

The next hallway was filled with zombies and the survivors are low on ammunition. Mike starts the action by blasting a Boomer Zombie from across the hall with his rifle.

Andrew plows though a small bunch of zombies, crushing the skull of each one.

Helicopter noises! Is someone going to save them?

As our refugees turns the corner, several zombies awake and beginning to sense the survivors. No one dares to take a step and set them off.

Eric kicks open the door to the roof. Outside there are a couple zombies that Andrew tosses off the edge. The helicopter circles around and spots the survivors. They're carried away

The wind kicked up; Mike shivered. There was a faint howl in the distance.

Eric shot a zombie standing next to an burnt police cruiser. Unluckily the car alarm still worked. Every zombie in the area started rushing towards Eric. A Tank Zombie took the front of the crowd, crushing several of his zombie allies. Ted set up a propane tank trap and ran as fast as possible. Impossibly, he shot over his shoulder and set off the bomb just in time. The gang was safe.

Foaad is severely wounded by a rampaging zombie. He's hurt but not a zombie.

Out of nowhere the Village People, as they called themselves, was cornered by a Spitter Zombie.

There was a loud bang as a Spitter Zombie with a whole horde of zombies crashed threw the wall be Ted and Ted pinning them to the wall. In an amazing show of bravery Eric shot the zombies pinning them to the wall and saved everyone.

Ted sped the car over a Spitter Zombie completely destroying the large zombie, causing structural damage to their car.

In the window above, a Hunter Zombie spotted them.

It starts to rain. The last thing Ted needs is wet gear and he makes it known. They look inside a nearby bombed-out apartment building.

Through the ceiling, a huge Charger Zombie fell on top of Mike. He became so enraged that he threw the zombie and a dozen other zombies out a window.

Foaad shoots a large fixture above a Smoker Zombie. The ceiling detaches and crushes the zombies, unfortunately destorying their path.

The group tries the elevator, but of course the door is pryed open. Inside the elevator shaft, zombies start crawling up the side. A Jockey Zombie grabs Foaad, in a cunning move, Ted shoots the elevator cable like he's seen in movies. The elevator comes crashing down and kills the zombies.

Foaad kills a Smoker Zombie, but the zombie's guts spoiled the bit of crackers they had left. Hopefully more food could be found in the bombed-out apartment building.

The top of the bombed-out apartment building is their goal. Flight after flight they've tried and now at what seems to be the 100th flight stands a Jockey Zombie. Ted uses a rocket launcher to vaporize it.

Opening a door, Mike disturbs a Tank Zombie.

Mike kicks open the door to the roof. Outside there are a couple zombies that Ted tosses off the edge. The helicopter circles around and spots the survivors. They're carried away

A Jockey Zombie took the front of the crowd, crushing several of his zombie allies. Foaad set up a propane tank trap and ran as fast as possible. Impossibly, he shot over his shoulder and set off the bomb just in time. The gang was safe.

With the escape boat in sight, a Boomer Zombie jumps out and surprises Foaad. Andrew quickly cuts the zombie's head off.

Mike fixed up a barricade in an attempt to escape the rushing horde. It wasn't going to hold. There were too many zombies. Foaad set up a distraction. Blasting away all the zombies from a nearby window.

Out of nowhere the gang was cornered by a Tank Zombie.

The group was sprinting between shadowed corners. Mike tripped briefly and alerted a nearby Jockey Zombie. Everyone tensed and quickly pulled their comrade up.

There was a loud bang as a Spitter Zombie with a whole horde of zombies crashed threw the wall be Andrew and Foaad pinning them to the wall. In an amazing show of bravery Foaad shot the zombies pinning them to the wall and saved everyone.

It takes almost all of the ammunition Mike has loaded, but he finally brings down a Tank Zombie.

A cloud moved across the sky, blocking the moon; it got unbearably dark.

Walking down the street, Eric stumbled over a trashcan making a loud clamor that echoed into the distance.

Andrew, Mike, Eric, and Foaad, had banded together as what seemed like the last survivors. The zombie apocalypse started 2 months ago, but the survivors knew more humans were still alive.

Zombies broke past their barricades. They all had to move quickly outside and luckily into their run-down ambulance.

They all huddled around Mike to reload.

In a tight street, Smoker Zombie and Smoker Zombie approached the group from either side. Andrew killed both with amazing marksmanship.

A Spitter Zombie rushes towards the survivors, followed by zombie stragglers. Mike dodges several swipes by another Smoker Zombie, then Mike shoots both zombie threats.

It starts to rain. The last thing Andrew needs is wet gear and he makes it known. They look inside a nearby police station.

There was a draft in the building. Really quite irritating.

Mike stumbles across a hidden cache of underwear. You never know how much you want clean underwear before you don't have it.

The next hallway was filled with zombies and the survivors are low on ammunition. Andrew starts the action by blasting a Jockey Zombie from across the hall with his rifle.

A zombie attack destroys their radio. They hadn't heard any radio transmission in days.

Through the ceiling, a huge Jockey Zombie fell on top of Andrew. He became so enraged that he threw the zombie and a dozen other zombies out a window.

Andrew shoots a large fixture above a Charger Zombie. The ceiling detaches and crushes the zombies, unfortunately destorying their path.

Zombies were sleeping or at least laying on the ground.
